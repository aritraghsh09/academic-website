									<p><b><u>Quick Summary:</u></b> We used a sample of $\sim3$
										million Hyper Suprime-Cam galaxies to demonstrate with $>5\sigma$
										confidence that galaxies in denser environments are upto $\sim25\%$
										larger than their counterparts with similar mass and morphology in less dense regions of the universe. This comprehensive study is an important step in resolving decades of contradictory results on this topic. It also sheds new light on how the structure of galaxies is connected with their dark matter halos; as well as their merger history.

									<figattr>The structure of a galaxy changes almost at every step in the hierarchical model 
										of galaxy formation. Thus, the correlation of galaxy structure with environment 
										acts as a powerful probe of both dark matter 
										halos and the baryonic processes within them.

								<p>
									The relationship between galaxy size and environment has remained enigmatic despite being 
									studied for more than a decade, with no broad consensus in the field. Different studies
									have reported wildly conflicting results beyond the local Universe ($z \geq 0.2$), 
									as summarized in the Table below. While some studies have reported a positive correlation
									of radius with the environment for certain subpopulations of galaxies; others have reported 
									no correlation; and yet others have reported a negative correlation.

								</span>
								<p>
		                         These conflicting results are primarily driven by:-
								 <ul>
									<li>Small Sample Sizes</li>
									<li>Absence of Robust Uncertainty Estimates on $R_e$</li>
									<li>Not Using Statistically Robust Techniques to Determine Correlation</li>
									<li>Not Properly Controlling for Nuisance Parameters (e.g., stellar mass, morphology)</li>
								</ul>
								<i><b>To properly tackle this challenge, we need a large uniform sample of galaxies with 
									accurate $R_e$ measurements and associated uncertainties, as well as a statistically robust
									technique to determine the correlation.
								</b></i>
								</p>

								<hr />

								<h3>What Did we Do?</h3>

								<p>
									In order to tackle the challenge outlined above, we correlated two publicly available catalogs 
									--- <a href="https://gampen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Public_data.html#hsc-wide-pdr2-galaxies" target="_blank">the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) structural parameter catalog</a> 
									with the <a href="https://hsc-release.mtk.nao.ac.jp/doc/index.php/density-map-catalog-pdr2/" target="_blank">HSC environmental density catalog</a> to create a
									sample of 3 million HSC galaxies at $ 0.3 \leq z < 0.7 $ with $m < 23$ and $ \log M/M_{\odot} \geq 8.9 $. 
									<b><i>Compared to previous studies, this overlapping sample is $\sim100-10,000$ times larger and goes 
									$\sim1$ dex deeper in mass-completeness. </i></b>

									that we correlated the HSC structural parameter catalog from Ghosh et al
									with the environmental density catalog from Shimakawa et al. "/>
									</span>
								</p> 

								<hr />

								<h3>What Did we Find?</h3>
								<p>First, we correlate the deviation in effective radius from the average size, 
									$ \Delta R_e = R_e - \overline{R_e}(M,L_B/L_T) $, against density excess measured
									using a top-hat of 10 co-moving Mpc ($\sigma_{r=10\,{\rm cMpc}}$). We perform the 
								    measurement separately in four different redshift slices.

									 $\Delta R_e = R_e - \overline{R_e}(M,L_B/L_T)$, 
									 \are plotted against density excess ($\sigma_{r=10\,{\rm cMpc}}$). "/>
									 <figattr>Checkmarks in the figure denote cases where we can reject the null-hypothesis of
									 no correlation at $ > 5\sigma $ confidence. To judge the presence of correlations while taking
									 into account the $R_e$ posterior distribution of each single galaxy, we use a 
									 Monte Carlo-based Spearman rank correlation test.

									in the last two slices. For galaxies with higher masses, the correlation can be confirmed 
									throughout the sample"/>
									</span>

								<p>An alternative way to answer our primary question is to investigate the size-mass relationship for 
									galaxies in different environments. Therefore, we performed a size-mass analysis for our entire 
								sample.</p>

										The second row shows how the colored points deviate from the overall 
										median (black dotted) trend line in the top row, i.e., 
										$ \delta R_e = R_e - \overline{R_e}(M) $. The bottom panels show the median values 
										of $ \Delta R_e = R_e - \overline{R_e}(M,L_B/L_T) $ for galaxies in different environments 
										at a given stellar mass.
										The gray dashed vertical lines throughout the figure show the overall mass-completeness
