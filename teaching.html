							<p> During my entire childhood and early adult years spent in India, some of 
								the most impactful decisions in my life were influenced by excellent teachers 
								and mentors. My interest in computation techniques &amp; astronomy were 
								both driven by individuals and teachers, who acted as role-models for me. 
							</p>

							<p>Because of this lived experience, I have always believed very strongly 
								that teachers and mentors can have a tremendous amount of real impact on 
								the lives of their students. Driven by this firm conviction, I have 
								passionately pursued every mentoring and teaching opportunity that I have 
								got. You can use the buttons below to explore some of them!</p>

								<h3>Yale PHYS 378: Co. Lead Instructor</h3>

								<p>I will be teaching 50% of a brand new undergraduate course at Yale titled ``Phys 378: Introduction to 
								Scientific Computing & Data Science" with <a href="http://www.astro.yale.edu/nagai/Welcome.html" target="_blank">
								Prof. Daisuke Nagai</a>. The goal of the course is to introduce Yale Physics & Astronomy 
								undergraduates to modern scientific computing methods. I will be focusing primarily on the second half 
								of the course which deals with supervized and unsupervized machine learning techniques.
								</p>

								<p><a href="https://poorvucenter.yale.edu/" target="_blank">The Yale Poorvu Center for Teaching &amp; 
									Learning</a> runs the competitive <a href="https://poorvucenter.yale.edu/Associates-in-Teaching-Program" 
									target="_blank">Yale Associates in Teaching Program</a> which allows advanced Ph.D. students to expand 
									their range of teaching experiences and responsibilities by co-designing and co-teaching a course 
									with a Yale faculty member
								</p>

								<p> Given how rapidly the scientific computing landscape, especially machine learning, has changed 
									in the last few years, Daisuke and I proposed this new course as a major redesign of
									a previously taught course, that focused mostly on more traditional forms of scientific computing. The course 
									aims to empower undergraduate students with a wide variety of analysis methods, tools, and techniques critical 
									in harnessing the next generation of large, complex, and interdisciplinary datasets.
								</p>

								<p>
									Given that this course primarily deals with programming, and guided by the latest research on pedagogical practices, 
									PHYS 378 will be delivered as a hands-on computing lab course, which meets weekly for a typical 3-hour session.
									Students will be expected to to watch one/two 10-minute
									videos at the beginning of every week, which will introduce to the mathematical/statistical aspects needed for every class.
									Then each class session will constitute of :- a) 40% planned class-room instruction (slides, chalkboard, and live-coding); b) 60% of 
									coding-time when students will be live-coding in small groups and instructors, teaching fellows will be walking around to
									assist them.
								</p>
								
								<p>There will also be a series of three Zoom seminars led by academic researchers and people from the 
									industry with practical machine learning experience held towards the latter half of the course. In addition 
									to the lab exercises, these are supposed to give the students more examples of real-life applications of 
									what they are learning and give them some ideas and inspiration for their final project. 
								</p>

								<p>Beginning Spring 2023, selected course materials from PHYS378 will be publicly available here!</p>

								<h3>Teaching Fellowhips &amp; Assistantships</h3>

								<p>Combining my time at the University of Groningen and Yale, I have instructed 
									undergraduates in a wide variety of settings and for courses at different 
									levels for a total of ten semesters. Most of the courses I taught at Yale 
									involved leading discussion-section and problem solving sessions. I have also 
									guest-lectured for a few courses 
									(mostly on data-science & machine learning) at Yale.</p>
									
									<p>For Advanced 
									Mechanics at the University of Groningen, I had the role of leading discussion-section
									and problem solving sessions. For the rest of the courses, I was a lab-instructor in-charge 
									of a specific experiment every year. Under a special arrangement of an expanded appointment,
									I also redesigning an old interferometer experiment and designed a new experiment on determining
									the decay time of muons.

								<h3>Meyerhoff &amp; Granville Scholars Programs</h3>

								<p>During my time at Yale, I was involved in two specific summer research programs, which 
								   aimed at training a more diverse and socially aware next generation of scientists.
								</p>

								<p><b>Meyerhoff Scholars' Program:</b> I have mentored and supervised three highly talented 
									undergraduate students from UMBC in the Urry Lab during the summers since 2018 as 
									part of the Meyerhoff Scholars Program. Responsibilities included an initial one-week 
									period of teaching followed by twice-a-week personal meetings to support them and oversee 
									their progress. The <a href="https://meyerhoff.umbc.edu/" target="_blank">Meyerhoff Scholars Program</a> 
									is at the forefront of efforts to increase 
									diversity among future leaders in science, technology, engineering and related fields. 
								</p>

								<p><b>Granville Academy:</b> I have taught incoming Yale Astronomy & Astrophysics summer 
									students as part of the two-week Granville Academy in 2018 and 2019. The program is named in honor 
									of Evelyn Boyd Granville, who obtained her Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale in 1949 and was the 
									second African-American woman to receive a Ph.D. in mathematics in the United States. Granville's 
									long career in research and teaching, including work in celestial mechanics digital computer techniques 
									for the Apollo program, was recognized in 2000 with the Yale Graduate School Alumni Association's highest honor, 
									the Wilbur Lucius Cross medal.
								</p>
								<p>
									All students who perform research in astronomy at Yale over the summer are typically a part of the academy. 
									The curriculum encompasses astronomical tools, social activism, and diversity in STEM. 
									( e.g., Statistics of Under-Representation, Equity in the Classroom, Implicit Bias, 
									Introduction to Astronomical coding, How to analyze data, etc.)

								<h3>Research Mentees</h3>

								<p>During my time at Yale, I have supervized and mentored 7 undergraduate students (3 Yale | 4 non-Yale)
								and one high-school student. This typically involved introducing students to computing/coding concepts,
								teaching them astronomical concepts, meeting with them weekly/bi-weekly to keep tabs on and plan future
								direction of their research projects. I have also been lucky to co-author papers with three of these 
								students!</p>
